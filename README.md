# MasksOfEternity
This plugins brings eternal masks, a powerful gauntlet and more difficulties to your Minecraft server.
## About
This plugin adds a few items to improve the vanilla gameplay into the next dimension. It also contains a custom dungeon generator made with WorldEdit's schematics.
## Installation
**Make sure you are using PaperMC 1.17.1+**
1. Go to your plugin directory
2. Paste the .jar file into the directory
3. Restart the server
### Note
The size of the plugin's jar file is higher than most of the other plugins with the same amount of classes or features because it is written in Kotlin.
## Compile
You need to meet the following requirements:
- Java 16 installed
- Permissions to run gradle tasks
Open up a terminal and type<br>
`gradlew shadowJar`

This will shade all the needed dependency into the jar and relocate the Kotlin library. The relocation is neccessary to run two different Kotlin plugins at the same time.
